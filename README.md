# OIX Visualisation for the Trusted Environment Project

## Introduction

This is the OIX Trusted Environment Discovery projects visualisation prototype. It is using the freely available REACT SOLID SDK from <a href="https://www.inrupt.com">Inrupt</a>.

The Trusted Environment project is working on an hypothesis that organisations with an existing relationship with someone can help those people prove who they are and what they are entitled to do by providing other organisations with proof of due diligence events that they have undertaken.
  
## SOLID

The project is run under the direction of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openidentityexchange.org/">Open Identity Exchange</a> and is sponsored by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service">UK Gov GDS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs">HMRC</a>. The working group includes <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hsbc.co.uk/">HSBC</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.santander.co.uk/">Santander</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions">Department for Work and Pensions</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service">Government Digital Services</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://next.factern.com/">Factern</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.idemia.com/">Idemia</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://mydex.org/">Mydex CIC</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tscheme.org/">tScheme</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zonafide.net/">Zonafide</a>.  

This is a prototype to explore how organisations might share Corroborating Events, such as Change of Residential Address event, using a personal data store of a customer. It is based on a SDK for use with a Social Linked Data (Solid) server. Solid is a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/solid/specification">W3C specification</a> for decentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles.

Solid started as a project at <a target="_blank" href="https://solid.mit.edu/">MIT</a> led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>.
  


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
